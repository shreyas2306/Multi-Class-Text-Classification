       "17472  i mean it’s honestly kinda insane how much music i’ve listened to and been inspired by  but rap to me is another way of songwriting  i think 2pac is a lot closer to the eagles than the eagles are to frank sinatra  the genre is different  but at the end of the day one the eagle’s greatest albums of all time was “hotel california” which told a story of the american dream more specifically the california dream and how it turned out to be a race to the bottom and left so many people empty and unfulfilled  i don’t see how that story is much different than the one being conveyed in “2pacalypse now”  \n",

       "18237      well  it helps that my partner is super patient   it’s definitely better to wait on your own terms because your partner is probably ready   we started by spending almost every night cuddling fully clothed in bed   then when i was more comfortable it lead to kisses before bed   then some in the morning   then we started slowly like one day removing his shirt for example   just little steps until i was comfortable to go all the way    the room was pitch black though too which helps    and he reminds me to breathe before even a kiss because he knows i’ll forget and freak out which also helps  \n",

       "12678  i'm home for the weekend and as i fold my clothes  i'm reflecting on elementary  school and then i remember 5th grade  i remember how i called a classmate who behind me 'cowpig ' it was mean and i at the time i believe i did it because my best friend at the time also called him that  he never reacted badly to it  usually ignoring us or something  we were kind of the wild loud people of the class because we did not care for science  this year i'm 20 and i've been reflecting a lot on what past actions and activities have made me who i am today  i'm active in my community  won an award for service work  graduated hs and currently is in a good college  my classmates who were in the same class  and hs as him  i wasn't  said the student i was mean to is also now in a good place  by that i mean they are in a top college as well    i know college name doesn't determine if the student is emotionally okay or not but i want to give myself a sense of \"i'm not a bad person\" reassurance  now i obviously know that name calling or ignoring him was mean and immature  i don't even know what drove me to partake it such behavior besides my school being kind of out-group and in-group style  i'm wondering if i should hit them up on fb and get coffee with them  i feel bad even though it was sooooo long ago but i can't help but want to do something to correct it? what does the internet think  \n",

       "23673  i believe that raising children with a religious mindset is the main cause for a fuckton of problems the world has  i believe it is better for them to grow up on a blank canvas and once they’re brain is fully developed they should be able to choose what they want to believe in  children that grow up with certain viewpoints often have drilled in their head that its their way or its wrong  its like a they have a tunnel vision that can cause an endless amount of wars and fights if they meet someone who doesn’t agree with them  i believe its also the reason why so many people are close minded and are reluctant to open their eyes to the fact that we live in a “free world” society  i hope im making sense here  im kinda just writing a summary of what my brain is saying  \n",

       "31173  question about residency status?ok so i have a specific situation and i’m having trouble answering the question myself  i grew up in california and spent my entire adult life there up until covid hit and i had to move to new mexico because a  i couldn’t afford to stay in la and my ex partner and our two cats and i had no where else to go  and b  i was helping take care of my elderly grandparents  i’m 28 years old for reference  left at 26  now i’m moving home to berkeley in the bay area where my dad has been my entire life and i wanted to go back to school  so onto my question  what the heck is the deal in my case with in state tuition? i unfortunately had to declare residency in nm because i have a car and i needed to register it there  so i’m no longer a california resident but i never had any intentions of leaving california i was forced to because of the pandemic  i realize i’m probably going to have to wait a year before i’m recognized as a resident  i think? according to what i’ve seen online  but if i pay for out of state tuition for the first year at a community college can i qualify for in state tuition once my residency is established? i would be working and living with my dad until i can find my own place  if it makes a difference i worked until the end of 2019 and paid taxes in california  and i’ve been on california unemployment ever since  \n",

       "23518  this teacher  lets call her karen because duh  was my math and science teacher  let's just say she was not the best math and science teacher  lets also say she had favorites and i was not one of them  also the main group who bullied me and my friend had about half the people in it in this class  so basically anytime one of them didn't like the way i was tapping my pen or bs like that i was yelled at  if they said anything harmful to me  karen would just brush it off and say something under her breath like \"stop being suck a baby op\"  in both of her classes i learned nothing  all she made us do was write notes that she had prewritten in her own notebook  the worst part about that was she wouldn't even let us write cheatsheets or look at our notebooks during tests  i know what you're thinking  \"oh that's what studying is for!\" well! she collected our notebooks at the end of class  this led to many screaming fights  she also gave an unreasonable amount of homework  one of the things i hated the most about her was in her googleature class  does anybody else have that? it's supposed to be a mix of computer stuff with books or something  she only stuck to the book part of it  also instead of letting us fill out a doc she could have easily shared with us  we had to do most of the work on packets that she had printed out  the only bit of computer anything she let us do was type out the vocab  karen also apparently has a very timed blatter so she made all of her students between science and googleature stand outside no matter the weather because she didn't want us to break anything  now  there's one more thing that i don't want to put here in full because it makes me uncomfortable talking about it online  but long story short she framed me for doing something horrible and told the principal of the school  the principal had to get me  he didn't believe her thank god  but the school counselor  amazing person  i miss you  let me stay in her office and play some games and talk a bit for the rest of class  that was it and i have had enough of her crap  and i left the school  i was homeschooled for the rest of the year and moved away to go to a great new school that summer  oh wow this feels great to get off my chest ya'll  \n",
